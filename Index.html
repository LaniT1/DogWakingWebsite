        <h1>Putāruru Dog Walkers</h1>
        <p>Hello my name is Emily and I am the owner of Putaruru Dog Walkers. Growing up in a small town, I have always grown up around dogs. I started this business at the age of 12 walking the neighbors dogs for some extra pocket money and it quickly became one of my favorite activities. 
           I walk all types of dog breeds and sizes, from a Jack Russell Terrier to a German Shepherd and everything in between. I do both group and Individual dog walks depending on your preference.  
           I am passionate about the safety and wellbeing of your dog so from the time I pick your dog up to the time I drop them home, your dog is my priority and I will ensure your dog is safe and happy. As I have grown up in Putaruru I know the places that dogs love to walk, making their walks fun and enjoyable.
